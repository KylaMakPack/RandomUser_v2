# RandomUser_v2

Version 2 based on Version 1 of randomuser. This fetches 7,000 users and provides inforamtion about the user. Currently the details button does not work to display selected individuals.

Questions: 
I keep getting unique key warnings, how do I fix that? 
Continually got COR policy errors and it prevented a lot of progress, I do not understand this in react?

I learned how important components are in react. My first version was very hard to access specific functions and variables, I was fetching all the data each time.
